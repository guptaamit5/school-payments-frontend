I sincerely apologize for the late submission.
Due to ongoing college exams, I could not dedicate enough time to the frontend UI design.
However, I have focused more on implementing the backend functionality, authentication, and payment workflows.

I will be happy to improve the frontend further if given additional time.
Thank you for your understanding.
